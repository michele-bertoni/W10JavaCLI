# Installation guide (Windows Only)
Author: Michele Bertoni

1. ## Clone repository
	* [Download repository](https://github.com/michele-bertoni/W10JavaCLI/archive/master.zip)
	* Unzip the downloaded archive

2. ## Install Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (BUW)
	* Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator by pressing ```WINDOWS + X``` and then selecting the correct voice
	* Enable the "Windows subsystem for Linux" (WSL) by running ```Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux```
	* Reboot when asked
	* Install [Ubuntu from Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6)
	* Launch the application and set username and password

3. ## Configure WSL
	* Move Ubuntu.lnk on the Desktop
	* Right click on the link, Properties
	* Add your profile name after ```C:\Users\``` (e.g. ```C:\Users\michele```)
	* If the icon is not automatically recognized, manually bind it: it should be in ```W10JavaCLI-master\link\ubuntu.ico```
	* From now on, by pressing ```CTRL + ALT + T``` you will open a new Bash window

4. ## Install Java
	* Download [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html) for Linux Compressed Archive (linux-x64_bin.tar.gz)	
	* Open WSL
	* Browse the download directory (it should be ```cd /mnt/c/Users/username/Downloads```)
	* From now on, I will consider jdk version ```14.0.1```, if yours is different, please edit the following commands
	* Create the installation directory ```sudo mkdir /usr/java```
	* Move the .tar.gz to the installation directory: ```sudo mv jdk-14.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz /usr/java/jdk-14.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz```
	* Install ```sudo tar zxvf jdk-14.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz```
	* Remove .tar.gz ```sudo rm jdk-14.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz```
	* Move to Home directory ```cd```
	* Open .bashrc ```nano .bashrc```
	* Add the following lines of code at the end of the file (please remind to eventually change jdk directory name):
		```
		# java
		export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk-14.0.1
		export PATH=${PATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/bin
		```
	* Save changes and close the text editor
	* Close WSL

5. ## Configure correct font
	* Install on Windows the font ```DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline.ttf``` by double-clicking it and selecting install (the file is included in the font directory of this repository)
	* Open WSL, then right-click the upper header and select Properties
	* Select ```DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline``` in the Font tab, then apply
	* Repeat this also for Default properties
	* You can also set the same font for IntelliJ IDEA console for easier debugging

6. ## Test
	* Double click on the HanoiTower.bat file (you might need to change jdk directory in the .sh file)
	* You should see an auto-solving Hanoi Tower, full colored, where the disks are composed by dice characters
	* If everything is right, the configuration is done
	* You can get inspiration from this test when making the final deployment of your java application
	
7. ## GUI (Optional)
	JavaFX or Swing application won't work on WSL and should be launched from Windows Shell. However, if you prefer having the entire application start from WSL, you can follow [this sub-guide](https://github.com/michele-bertoni/W10JavaCLI/blob/master/GuiForWSL.md)
